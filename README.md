The main components include an 8-bit Serial Adder, which integrates a parallel-in serial-out (PISO) shift register, a D flip-flop, and a full adder to sequentially add two 8-bit numbers. The modules also include individual implementations of the PISO shift register, the D flip-flop, and the full adder, all critical for the serial addition process. The testbench provided, serial_adder_tb.v, verifies the functionality of the serial adder by applying test inputs and checking the outputs.
