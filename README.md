This repository, "Module Design Using Verilog," contains a comprehensive collection of Verilog modules aimed at digital circuit design and FPGA implementation. Within it, you'll find various basic digital circuits such as 8-bit serial and parallel adders, 8-bit multipliers, and full adders realized using multiplexers. Additionally, the repository includes designs for 4-bit code converters, magnitude comparators, and an 8-bit fixed-point arithmetic logic unit (ALU). Essential components like universal shift registers and both synchronous and asynchronous counters are also covered. For more complex designs, there's the implementation of finite state machines (FSM) in both Moore and Mealy configurations, as well as memory modules.
